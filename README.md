This project was created using "create-react-app"
The goal of this project was to organize a react front end in a way that made logical sense utilizing react-redux. 

I was able to create individual components and combine them to create a sliding menu bar with rollable dice used for tabletop RPGs

I intend to add additional component/features to practice using react. 

Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- React
- Redux 
- React-Redux 
- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap

Some future features I hope to implement would be:
- Authentication
- Node/Express/PostgreSQL backend for user and game information storage.
- Being able to log in to a session with other players and view the results of their rolls to a commong "dice tray"
- A chat function to allow communication between all players or individuals
- Desktop and Mobile browser views
- Would like to use React Native to create a downloadable mobile app.

I hope to be able to integrate existing components into other areas, such as putting a dice rolling component in the chat window itself if you need to roll a private dice with your game master.

This would also show the mobility of the components that I was able to create and how one can be imbedded in another for use in other areas of the app.

One such example would be using the dice rolling and output window components to send private rolls over a future chat system.
